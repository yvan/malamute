malamute
========

Malamute is a little file manager that allows your share files with nearby
friends. It doesn't require a network wifi or internet connection.

Currently the best implementation we have lets you pick some photos are share
them with a best bud or best gal.

Note of warning: All UI elements were made with autolayout to work on any device.
Please do not change any layout configurations without first testing on all device
simulators.

Code Structure
==============

## ViewController

The ViewController class controls the display of the app. The most important parts
of this class are our buttons and the UICollectionView that displays the icons for
each file's representation. The other important asp

## Networking

We used the Multipeer Connectivity (MC) Framework to beam files from User to User. After
having used the MC framework on a previous hackathon project (<a href="https://twitter.com/yvanscher">wave</a>) we knew that it
would be problematic to throw all the MC delegate methods and session objects
into the main ViewController class. So we created wrappers for the Session, Browser, and
Advertiser. This modularity is cleaner from a reader's perspective, it's maintainable, and
allows us to re-use the same wrappers on different projects. The ViewController is a delegate
of each wrapper and the wrappers send information in one direction to the ViewController
which then effects the appropriate changes in the FileSystem and View.

## FileSystem

Deal with the app sandbox was the hardest part of this project. There are not visual
representations of the filesystem while developing. The filesystem is located in
the FileSystem class; it contains arrays which havemany "File" (a class we made)
objects. The filesystem is an created as an object in the ViewController class
and manipulated there. The class itself contains many methods for manipulating
the app sandbox filesystem. Their names are pretty obvious and each method
has comments describing what it does. Crucial the filesystem saves on app
crashing or entering the background, this is a precaution measure, if
we don't do this we risk losing user data.
This happens in AppDelegate.

Todo
====
1. Find a way to automatically enable the user's wifi card and bluetooth, it's
a pain to have to check to make sure they are on every time we run the app. I mean
once they are turned on there's no reason for them to be off again for a long time,
it's still lame to have to check.

2. Add a user queue so that new users joining previously active sessions can send
a signal to users already in the session to send them their stuff.

3. Connect to Dropbox, box, other file services via the sync API that's really
when this app becomes useful.

4. Find a way to hook up this app to the itunes library?
